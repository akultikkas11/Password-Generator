  - Generated password (`password`)
  - Toggles for allowing numbers (`numberAllowed`) and special characters (`characterAllowed`)
  - Tooltip text for copy button (`toolTipText`)

- `useEffect`  
  Triggers password regeneration whenever dependencies (`length`, `numberAllowed`, `characterAllowed`) change, ensuring the password stays updated with user preferences.

- `useRef`  
  References the password input field to programmatically select its content when copying to clipboard.
